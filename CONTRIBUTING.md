## How to Propose a New Snippet

1. **Format**: All snippets must be in Xcode `.codesnippet` format (XML/plist). Use clear, descriptive names and triggers in English.
2. **Categories**: Place your snippet in the most appropriate folder:
   - `Snippets/SwiftUI/`
   - `Snippets/UIKit/`
   - `Snippets/AsyncAwait/`
   - `Snippets/Architecture/`
   - `Snippets/Extensions/`
3. **Naming**: Name the file according to its main purpose (e.g. `Button.codesnippet`, `ViewModel.codesnippet`).
4. **Trigger**: Use a short, memorable trigger for code completion.
5. **Description**: Fill in the snippet's title and summary fields for clarity.
6. **Reusability**: Snippets should be general, reusable, and follow Swift best practices.
7. **Language**: All snippet content, triggers, and documentation must be in English.
8. **No Duplicates**: Check the existing snippets to avoid duplicates or near-duplicates.
